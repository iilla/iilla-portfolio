# Portfolio Ignasi Illa

This is my personal Portfolio showing some of my most representative jobs. It is a selection of websites and applications that can portray my skills as web developer and also help others seeking for inspiration for similar projects. I hope you enjoy it!

## Tecnologies used

### Html and Css

This portfolio was made mainly raw html5 and css3 maquetation.

### Javascript with jQuery

The javascript functions control all interactive and visual events, from manual keyboard input for navigation to language swap and other visual effects. It is also included the amazing CarouFredSel ( https://github.com/Codeinwp/carouFredSel-jQuery ) for the images. 


## Installation

Feel free to check the code and use it for personal purposes... after you apply the necessary changes, of course. Just delete any reference that can relate it to myself and it will be allright. You only need to upload these files to your domain, and it will work normally. I've not changed links, nor images, that's up to you!
